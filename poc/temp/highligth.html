In a production-ready implementation of such a function, there’d be a lot more
work to do. For example, what if the first argument isn’t an array? What if the second
isn’t a function? How would you allow the page author to terminate the loop at any
point? As an exercise, you can augment the function to handle these situations.
Another exercise you could task yourself with is to enhance the function so that
the page author can also pass an arbitrary number of arguments to the callback in
addition to the iteration index.
But given that apply() and call() do pretty much the same thing, how do we
decide which to use?
The high-level answer is the same answer as for many such questions: we’d use
whichever one improves code clarity. A more practical answer would be to use the one
that best matches the arguments we have handy. If we have a bunch of unrelated val-
ues in variables or specified as literals, call() lets us list them directly in its argument
list. But if we already have the argument values in an array, or if it’s convenient to col-
lect them as such, apply() could be the better choice.
